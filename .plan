+ prepare train-data => [left, right, top_seg, top_ipm] 
+ generate dataset.json
+ fix train.py
+ train trimmed model
+ convert / visualize top_seg file in rgb
* visualize models 
* migrate to recommended pytorch / vision version
+ fix bev_segmented dataset
+ convert bev_segmented to single channel 


- fix poor results

- why is segmented-bev not centered in GT data? 
- fix preprocessing
- fix num_workers for train_loader
- fix transpose=True for SegLoader
- importance of transpse
- figure out the co-ordinate system



+ visualise cropped-seg-masks-mono in rgb
+ eval on the trained model
- generate square shaped top_seg train-data
- provision for multiple training log folders
