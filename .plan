- --> to-do

+ prepare train-data => [left, right, top_seg, top_ipm] 
+ generate dataset.json
+ fix train.py
+ train trimmed model
+ convert / visualize top_seg file in rgb
* visualize models 
* migrate to recommended pytorch / vision version
+ fix bev_segmented dataset
+ convert bev_segmented to single channel 

- fix poor results

- use 2 classes => void + canopy

+ fix GT seg-mask resolution across files
* why are there huge black patches in GT? 
+ why is segmented-bev not centered in GT? 
- fix model preprocessing step
- fix num_workers for train_loader
- fix transpose=True for SegLoader
- importance of transpse
- figure out the co-ordinate system

- utility to generate bev frames to s3

+ visualise cropped-seg-masks-mono in rgb
+ eval on the trained model
- generate square shaped top_seg train-data
- provision for multiple training log folders
